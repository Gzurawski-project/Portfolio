## About Me

My name is Gage Zurawski (he/him/they) a technology professional with experience in leadership and management for software engineering teams.  I have also served as a Business Analyst and Product Owner/Manager for engineering teams as well.  Teams I have worked with have been full-stack supporting all aspects of building and managing the applications and services they support.  I have also worked through every aspect of the Software Delivery Life Cycle (SDLC) from inception of ideas, to implementation and support of the product, to teardown of systems.

I have over 10 years of experiencing working with teams leading or contributing towards numerous OKRs and KPIs for these teams.

I leverage critical thinking and problem-solving skills to drive delivery and process improvement for organizations and development teams.  Recognized for growing teams and software engineering professionals through strong work ethic, relationship-building, servant leadership, collaborative spirit, and adaptability.  Deadline driven without sacrificing work quality.  Thrive in an environment that embraces collaboration as well as individual contributions.  Leverage client and user data to help drive results across the team.


Outside of work I am involved with foam fighting (LARP) and steel fighting communities.  I lead a unit of 50+ people in foam fighting where I have been involved with for the past 11 years.  This gives me opportunity to work with individuals from a diversified background to help them grow, train, or take on new responsibility in a fun and engaging environment.  I serve as a mentor for many subcommunities where I am often traveling across the nation to participate and share feedback with other growing fighters. Additionally, this gives me opportunity to help organize people for running and coordinating larger scale events from 50-250 attendees ranging from single day to multi-days events.  
I have also in the last 4 years got into steel fighting (Buhurt/HMB) which has given me plenty of opportunity to train myself and look for continued avenues of personal growth.  I am one of the Field Captains for the Detroit Fight Club, and also help to train and work with other club members as we look to compete across the country.


### Current Ambitions

I really enjoy the opportunity to work closely with development teams to create great solutions and find better ways we can accomplish objectives together.  I like to spend efforts ensuring that information and conversation can happen regularly within teams and how to best raise collaboration and insight across all those supporting shared initiatives.  I'm a firm believer that in order to build great solutions together takes investing in your teams to ensure each other can be effective participants in that process.
